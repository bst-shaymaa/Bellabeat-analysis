# Bellabeat-analysis
The goal of this project is to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and how to apply these insights into Bellabeat's marketing strategy using these three questions:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
